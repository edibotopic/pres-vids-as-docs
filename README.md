# Video and docs

Slides for a session on video and documentation.

Originally presented at Canonical sprint in The Hague, Oct 2024.
Later presented at Write the Docs, Ireland.

The slides are made with reveal.js using a rudimentary, custom Ubuntu theme.

The presentation makes heavy use of embedded video that I have not had the opportunity to compress yet!!!

## Outline

Most software documentation is text-based.
Video often seems like a poor alternative.
Videos are difficult to create, maintain and version.
Some videos should probably just be plain text, such as
a video that consists solely of terminal commands.

Video can, however, be a natural solution for specific kinds of documentation problem.
An obvious example is a graphical application with a rich and responsive interface.

In this talk, I will discuss how:

* Certain kinds of interface are best demonstrated through video
* New tools make video documentation easier to create and maintain
* Video is well suited to documentation for acquiring skill or understanding

Even if we choose not to use video, thinking about what video does well may
help us write better documentation.
